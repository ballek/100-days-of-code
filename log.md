# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Dusted off the Portfolio challenge, very quickly scrapped it. Rebuilding piece by piece, testing my own code!

**Thoughts:** I am feeling very frustrated and overwhelmed today- I built this about a month ago and I feel like I'm starting from square one!

### Day 1: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed buttons, gave them hover effects. Fixed fa icon hover effects. Implemented a "nav" and planning to play with responsive effects. 

**Thoughts:** Scrapping the portfolio page was the right call. I'm googling piece by piece and feeling much more comfortable.
