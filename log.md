# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Dusted off the Portfolio challenge, very quickly scrapped it. Rebuilding piece by piece, testing my own code!

**Thoughts:** I am feeling very frustrated and overwhelmed today- I built this about a month ago and I feel like I'm starting from square one!
